김태호와 송관형의 다사다난할(?) 기계학습 입문용 리포입니다.  

## Objectives

The objective of this repo is several-fold.  
* Learning the basics of Machine Learning through real-world competitions and datasets
* Getting used to Version Control via git, especially when multiple people contribute simulataneously
* Handling the 2021-2022 winter break like a real pro  


## Goals

We have done / will do several ML projects and competitions.
